# Jute_telegram_bot
This project is to create a Telgram Bot. I have created this bot for supporting a Jute marketing comapany. You can try to implement for your own appications.

*Here we are using the AIOGRAM library to map the Telegram the commands*

# Code Implementation

We have to create our own bot from the BotFather and note down the API Token generated in the enviroment. Using this we can start editing the functionailty of out bot.

After this we can also create a payment link by linking with the third party resources supported by telegram and then use it to link the payment gateway like I did in this code.
 
*Note: To add emojies to your chat. you have to install emoji library, but if you are using version 20 of telegram bot, then i would suggest typing the emoji directly into the text.*

At last for making this code work check out the changes I made in in the exection branch.
